              <h2>Digital Fortress</h2>

              <p>The client had a hungry sales team but not enough prospects to keep them all busy. After spending considerable sums of money on individual leads, they contracted my services to develop their own digital marketing collateral and assets. After we consulted, it was clear they needed to create digital marketing assets that would generate organic traffic and keep their sales team busy for years to come. They had no marketing activity beyond maintaining a website at the time of initial consultation.</p>

              <p>During this engagement I helped the client overhaul their website and brand presence. We created a funnel-nurture campaign using Salesforce Pardot, and developed a comprehensive inbound marketing program. I wrote copy for PPC ads on LinkedIn and Facebook, and developed corresponding landing pages.</p>

              <p>I managed vendor and content-creator relationships, created the content marketing strategy and discovered underserved market segments. I trained and educated the client on best-in-class tactics and advised on launching their initial digital marketing campaigns.</p>
