              <h2>Microsoft Superheroes</h2>

              <p>The Microsoft Superheroes project was a training gamification that began with the client's need to prove their massive organization had retained internal best practices and objectives going into the new fiscal year.</p>

              <p>We approached this heavy undertaking with a fresh perspective. Working with the client, we determined that weaving together key personalities from the organization with a Superhero/Fantasy narrative would be memorable and engaging. We wanted to make a genuinely entertaining game that would raise the bar for all future training initiatives for our client.</p>

              <p>We reached out to a longtime collaborator, Brian Thies (a comic book artist with credits at Marvel Comics, Dark Horse Comics, among others) to create a visual world straddling both the everyday business struggles that Microsoft customers face and the fantastical world of Superheroes.</p>

              <p>Supported by my team, I wrote a story arch with our Microsoft client organization against the mysterious supervillain Vexx. In order to defeat various plots by Vexx, the Microsoft team members had to study internal objectives and best practices, then answer questions to prove they learned the material. Our team wrote the codebase and the engine the gamification operated on.</p>

              <p>All told, the game had over forty unique pieces of art, seven large panel pieces, eleven unique character profiles created from real photos of the clientâ€™s executive team all woven together to make the game a resounding success for our client.</p>
