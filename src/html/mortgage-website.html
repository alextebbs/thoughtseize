              <h2>Mortgage Website and Brand Pivot</h2>
              <p>The client was growing operations and investing in marketing assets. The client uses a larger national mortgage company for licensing but wanted to differentiate his brand, so we consulted for a number of months before deciding on a sub-brand. From there, we developed a name, logo, brand positioning, and then created all-new marketing collateral.</p>

              <p>We overhauled the design of the website, focusing on the Loan Officer personalities. Breaking from the financial industry's stiffness, we included personal anecdotes and real laughter in the videos, perfectly encapsulating the unique culture of this small but strong company.</p>

              <p>I trained and advised internal marketing team members on Facebook ad buying and digital marketing tactics, optimized for use with the new website. Each Loan Officer has a profile on the website, empowering them to drive traffic independently to generate leads for themselves. This solved numerous problems for the client, but also allowed the client to drive traffic to the branch site.</p>

              <p>I collaborated with <a href="https://www.genevievepierson.com">Genevieve Pierson</a> to create ten videos. Genevieve shot, edited, and advised on final cuts while I produced, wrote the script, and interviewed the team on location.</p>
