              <p>The goal for the team was growing registrations and engagement through an event series and through a webinar initiative. I worked with the client to revise and update brand guidelines, update copy, and launch various support campaigns. The branding was aimed to be aspirational while being accessible. It sought to bring together many different parties from across the business ecosystem and unify them towards collaboration utilizing Microsoft platform solutions. We adhered to Microsoft Brand guidelines while differentiating the IoT in Action brand internationally. I handled logistics for the IoT events in San Francisco in 2018 and managed vendor relationships.</p>
