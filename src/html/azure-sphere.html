              <h2>Microsoft Azure Sphere</h2>

              <p>We had the unique opportunity of partnering with a longtime client at Microsoft to quickly stand-up a registration site for a top-secret product release. The unique challenge the client faced was they needed to document that each attendee of the event had signed an NDA for a product that no one could talk about. Through strategic leveraging of assets on hand from previous Microsoft communications, we created a site that captured the attention of customers and confirmed registrations on an extremely tight timeline.</p>

              <p>We wrote a unique code to verify that each unique NDA was logged and saved along with an easy to navigate registration website for an event that was held on Microsoft Campus in December of 2017. Since the product was top-secret and they were trying to beat their competition to market, our client had to lean on us for numerous engagements simultaneously. We handled creative, signage, logistics, web/email marketing and hands-on personally tailored content editing for executive presentations.</p>

              <p>This top-secret product release would of course eventually be unveiled as Azure Sphere which is summarized in the video below:</p>
