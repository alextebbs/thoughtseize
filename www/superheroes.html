              <h2>Microsoft Superheroes</h2>

              <p>The Microsoft Superheroes project was a training gamification that began with the client's need to land always-evolving objectives for their internal national marketing organization.</p>

              <p>The game featured executive leadership from the organization within a Comic-Superhero narrative. We knew that employees of the organization would engaged by seeing their bosses and executive team in Superhero outfits!. The goal was to make a genuinely entertaining game that would raise the bar for quality and experience all future training initiatives.</p>

              <p>We reached out to longtime collaborator Brian Thies (a comic book artist with credits at Marvel Comics, Dark Horse Comics, among others) to create a visual world straddling both the practical struggles Microsoft customers face with the fantastical world of Superheroes.</p>

              <p>I wrote a narrative with our Microsoft client pitted against the mysterious supervillain Vexx. In order to defeat various plots by Vexx, the Microsoft team members had to study internal objectives and best practices, then answer questions to prove they learned the material. Our team wrote the codebase and the engine the gamification operated on. I managed the creative ideation, the execution and planning of phases of gameplay, and managed the full release cycle of the software to align with client goals.</p>

              <p>All told, the game had a massive forty unique pieces of creative, seven hand-drawn large panel scenes, and eleven unique character profiles created from photos of the clientâ€™s executive team.</p>
