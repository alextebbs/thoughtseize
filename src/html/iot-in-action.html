              <p>The goal for the team was growing registrations and engagement through an event series and through a webinar initiative. I worked with the client to revise and update brand guidelines, update copy, and launch various support campaigns. IoT in Action brought various parties from across the business ecosystem to unify them towards building new solutions. We adhered to Microsoft Brand guidelines while differentiating the IoT in Action brand internationally.</p>
